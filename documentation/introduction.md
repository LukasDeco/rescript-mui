`rescript-material-ui` provides [ReScript](https://rescript-lang.org/) bindings
for the Javascript based UI library [MUI](https://mui.com/) (formerly
[MaterialUi](https://material-ui.com/)).

The bindings are automatically generated by utilizing the documentation
generation scripts of the original package. These rely on a mix of code & code
annotations and are not always 100% accurate.

This will directly translate into the bindings. If you come across a missing
prop on a component or a misbehaving component, please feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/cca-io/rescript-material-ui/issues).

## Binding format

The automatic nature of the bindings make some parts of it seem a little clunky.
This cannot be avoided, as some things just need to be generalized. Please refer
to the individual sections in `Project Structure` to to see what patterns are
used.
