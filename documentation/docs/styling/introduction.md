For styling `rescript-material-ui` components, you need to pass CSS class names
to them. We have documented the following popular options:

- [`useStyles` hook](use-styles) (new in 3.0.0)
- [CSS](css)
- [Tailwind CSS](tailwind)
- [a CSS-in-ReScript library like `bs-css`](bs-css)
- [`Styles PPX`](styles-ppx) (not recommended)
